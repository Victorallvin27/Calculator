## Introduction
This project implements a simple calculator in Java, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It accepts multiple inputs and allows users to select the desired operation to be performed on those inputs.

## Features
Addition: Adds all the provided values.
Subtraction: Subtracts subsequent values from the first value.
Multiplication: Multiplies all the provided values.
Division: Divides the first value by the subsequent values.

## Project Structure
Calc.java: The main file containing the logic for different arithmetic operations and the user interface (command-line interaction).

## How It Works
## User Input:
The user is prompted to enter the number of values.
The user then enters the values, one by one.
The user selects one of the following operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

## Output:
Based on the userâ€™s choice, the corresponding operation is performed on the input values.
The result of the operation is then displayed to the user.

## Exit:
The program terminates after displaying the result.

## Code Structure
addition(float[] value): Adds all the elements in the array.
subtraction(float[] value): Subtracts the elements from the first value.
multiplication(float[] value): Multiplies all the elements in the array.
division(float[] value): Divides the first value by the subsequent values.

## Limitations
Division by zero will result in an exception.
The program assumes that the user will provide valid numerical inputs.
